## üß† How It Works

The app uses vanilla JavaScript to interact with DOM elements and Chrome APIs (in extension context) to fetch the current tab. Data is stored in `localStorage` and rendered dynamically.

### Main Functions:
- `render(leads)` ‚Äì Renders a list of links from the `myLeads` array.
- `inputBtn` ‚Äì Adds the manually entered URL to the list.
- `tabBtn` ‚Äì Adds the current tab‚Äôs URL.
- `deleteBtn` ‚Äì Clears all saved leads on double-click.
